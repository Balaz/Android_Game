Tic Tac Toe game

I created this project because I wanted to pratice the Python language with a version control system.
This is a Tic Tac Toe table game, which I tought would be a nice start into game developement using the pygame module.

Rules: The players can only have 3 marks on the table.
       After that it works like a LiFo system - your first mark will dissapear and so on in the following order in each round
